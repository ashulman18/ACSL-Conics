# Conics

From a 2001-2002 ACSL Senior Division Program

The general form of the equation for each is Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0. 
They differ because of the restrictions placed on the coefficients in the table above.
For the circle A and C must be equal and B must equal 0. For the ellipse, A and C cannot 
be equal but must have the same sign. B must equal 0. An example of an equation of a circle is:
x2 + y2 + 4x - 6y –3 = 0. An example of an equation of an ellipse is: x2 + 4y2 - 6x - 16y – 11 = 0. 
In this program you will be given the general form of the equation and must determine if it is a circle,
an ellipse, a hyperbola or a parabola. Further, you will have to give certain other information about the 
figure such as radius and center.
